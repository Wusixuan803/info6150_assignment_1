    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
      Hello! I'm Sixuan Wu. I currently live in California and am pursuing a
      Master's degree in Information Systems at Northeastern University. I love
      learning new things, especially when it comes to coding and exploring how
      technology can make life easier. When I'm not studying, I enjoy spending
      time outdoors and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that a balanced life is important, so I try to mix my passion
      for technology with hobbies that allow me to unwind and recharge.
    </p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Going for morning jogs along the beach</li>
      <li>Experimenting with new recipes and baking treats</li>
      <li>Watching documentaries about space and nature</li>
      <li>Spending quality time with friends and family over coffee</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>One of My Favorite Places</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Taking time to relax and recharge is essential</strong> for
      staying productive and focused. It's important to
      <em>balance work and personal life</em>, and I try to find time for both.
      Sometimes, I just enjoy a quiet evening reading a good book or watching a
      movie to unwind.
